While it shares its basic silhouette with the comparatively pedestrian A5/S5 coupe, the RS5 is an entirely different beast. At its core is a 450-hp 4.2-liter naturally aspirated V-8 that loves to rev to its 8300-rpm redline. (For those keeping score, thatвЂ™s more than double the 220 horsepower produced by the turbocharged 2.0-liter four found in the A5 and 117 more than the 333-hp 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 in the S5.) All-wheel drive is standard, and AudiвЂ™s seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic is the sole transmission choice.');

And the engine has more than sufficient power to move all of the above at ridiculous speeds. In BMW world, a single M indicates a high-performance version. In this case, it's the 5 Series that has the extra power, plus all of the necessary suspension, braking, aerodynamic and accommodation upgrades. This generation of 5 Series demonstrates a shift away from the enthusiast and more toward the luxury buyer.

All-wheel drive is standard on each version; so, too, is a harsh ride. Sadly, this icon has been discontinued and won’t be replaced in the lineup')
